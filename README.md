## 🛥 What is Stream?
Stream allows developers to rapidly deploy scalable feeds, chat messaging and video with an industry leading 99.999% uptime SLA guarantee.

Stream provides UI components and state handling that make it easy to build video calling for your app. All calls run on Stream’s network of edge servers around the world, ensuring optimal latency and reliability.
